Numerical_Lab2
======

Second lab assignment for Numerical Methods in university. You probably have zero interest in this. C.

The task was to write a program that would solve an equation via different methods. My assignment was the 'x^2 + 2*sin(x) - 1 = 0' equation solved with iterative and Newton's methods.

Implementation mostly boiled down to 'Take an equation from lab manual and replicate it in code'.

Assignment also involved outputting results in a table. For that I used the table printing functionality from Numerical_Lab1 (you can read more about it there).

Second assignment did not involve abundant comments, so I put comments only where I considered them to be useful and/or necessary.

Makefile is the one I used with many other labs, it's purpose is simply 'compile all sources in the directory into object files and assemble those into an executable'.
